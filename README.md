FAQ:
When first logging into the project repo always perform a "git pull"
This will gather all the files that your teammates have worked on while you were away.

Start or modified  a file- open ipython, txt, md, etc. 
"git add <filename>": Track the file now
"git status": gives me what the repo looks like
"git commit -m "message"": The actual instatiation of the update on some list 
"git push": This will add your changes to the big repo
